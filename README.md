# Sahoora-Porfolio
I built this Portfolio &amp; Achievements website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome icons. It showcases my projects, certifications, and professional skills. Each project includes detailed descriptions and links to supporting documents or repositories. The portfolio is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and professional presentation.
